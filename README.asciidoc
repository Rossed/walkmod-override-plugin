walkmod-override-plugin
=======================
Raquel Pau <raquelpau@gmail.com>

This is a walkmod plugin to add the override annotation in Java methods whenever it is necessary 
(when a given class implements an interface or defines a method that belongs to its superclass). 

== Example
Let's see an example. From this code, which is a class with its typical `toString` implementation. 

```java
package example;

public class Foo{
 
  public String toString(){
    ...
  }
}
```

It is transformed to :
```java
package example;

public class Foo{

  @Override
  public String toString(){
    ...
  }
}
```

== Usage


=== Only Walkmod >= 2.2.0

Just type:

----
walkmod add override
----
and then, to see the results:

----
walkmod apply
----
